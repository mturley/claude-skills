# Claude Code Instructions

This is a **public repository**. Before making any commit, review the staged changes for:

- API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Internal URLs, hostnames, or IP addresses
- Personal information (emails, usernames tied to internal systems)
- References to private repos, internal project names, or proprietary systems

If you find anything that looks like it shouldn't be public, **stop and describe it to the user** before committing. Ask them to confirm whether the content is safe to publish.
